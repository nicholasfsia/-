          <h2 class="c1">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>Flashfood has grown rapidly this past year. During that time, Flashfood has gone through some redesigns done by several agencies and firms. This caused problems of inconsistency and context lacking in the design. Much variability was found in the design creating a longer development time and incoherence. Thus, during my time at Flashfood, I redesigned the Flashfood app focusing on business growth and shoppers shopping experience. The ultimate goal is to tie things together so that the shoppers can have a fluid end-to-end experience. The design process consisted of research and auditing, assemble-disassemble, and designed for consistency, modularity, and reusability. The final design is implemented in stages and resulted in more partnership and investment. Also, the new design allows prototyping of new products quicker, thus makes experimentations cost lower. After my time there, I am fortunate enough to work on contract remotely. I am currently working on the partner facing app, focusing on the posting flow.

        <div class="content_block">
          <h2 class="c1">Problems</h2>
          <p>Flashfood grocery app is an app that allows grocers to sell surplus food that is almost expired and allows the shoppers to browse those food items, buy them at a discount, and pick them up in store.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Flashfood had gained multiple partners in several cities in Canada including London, Toronto, Vancouver, and now in the US. While its growth in shoppers and partners are rapidly expanding, in this one-year period, Flashfood hadn’t had any internal design resources prior to my arrival. All the design works were externally outsourced to different firms and agencies. This caused problems of inconsistency and context lacking in the design. Much variability was found in the design causing longer development time and incoherence. The app was previously redesigned (from version 1.0) by an agency yet they still missed the marks. The agency version will be referred as version 2.0 and the new redesign will be referred as version 2.1.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The demand for new locations keeps increasing; thus the growth of grocers and shoppers should be expected. The version 2.0 of the app was not designed with scalability in mind. With the expansion, the app can be confusing for the user and cause purchase errors. Not only it confuses the shoppers but also adds extra works for the operation management at Flashfood to handle refunds manually. In addition, the team agreed that the version 2.0 of the app is not a good reflection of the company from quality and context standpoint. It does not show company’s professionalism and commitment to the product. This is an important problem because users now expect good design, either primary (shoppers) or secondary (grocers) or tertiary (investors) users. The company is still relying on investment and to obtain investments, the product has to reflect the vision and commitment of the company.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_block">
          <h2 class="c1">Goals</h2>
          <p>The primary goal is to effectively and efficiently redesign Flashfood grocery app for business growth and shopper satisfaction. The business growth is regarding more products sold, more stores, more investments, more shoppers, and easy new product integration. The shopper satisfaction is regarding a seamless transition from version 1 to version 2 without unpleasant surprises and enhancing the experience to reduce purchase error.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_block">
          <h2 class="c1">Requirements</h2>
          <p>From reviewing goals and limitations of the project, a set of requirements were made. The project must meet the following requirements:</p>
          <ul class="ul1 ul_content">
            <li>The interface must allow easy new product integration</li>
            <li>The interface must be designed for iOS and Android mobile</li>
            <li>The user experience should have a new flow that reduces shopper purchase error</li>
            <li>The user experience should retain shoppers to keep the Flashfood grocery app</li>
            <li>The overall app experience should reflect the company’s value and culture in the efforts to gain more investments, partnership, and users</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="c1">Approach</h2>
            <div class="content_subblock">
              <h3>User feedbacks</h3>
              <p>User feedbacks were compiled from Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Facebook, and Google reviews. Most feedbacks are positive but there are some insightful suggestions and common issues regarding the app and the experience. The reviews were reviewed and categorized into four different groups, which are stores and location, usability and app performance, food options, and skepticism.</p>
              <ul class="ul1 ul_content">
                <li>Stores and location</li>
                  <ul class="ul1_nested ul_nested_content">
                    <li>More stores in a specific city</li>
                    <li>More location (other cities)</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Usability and app performance</li>
                  <ul class="ul1_nested ul_nested_content">
                    <li>Very glitchy</li>
                    <li>The app is substandard execution (design and development)</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Food options</li>
                  <ul class="ul1_nested ul_nested_content">
                    <li>Not much selections</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Skepticism</li>
                  <ul class="ul1_nested ul_nested_content">
                    <li>Why not donate to the food bank instead?</li>
                    <li>Still processed industrial scale</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>This list helped to find the focus on the redesign and understand what the customer truly feels about the version 1.0 of the app. Some of the issues such as location and item selections, Flashfood has no control over those. However, the comments regarding poor execution are important feedback and need to be taken seriously. This led me to focus on designer-developer communication through specs, reviews, and feedback loop. While another issue regarding skepticism was found, Flashfood Inc. needs to be proactive in communicating its goal to reduce food waste and be clear on how does Flashfood approaches can help to solve food waste problems.</p>

              <h3>Market research</h3>
              <p>The market research was done by adapting heuristic evaluation. The main focus of this market research is to learn best practice on product display and product details. 21 iOS apps from several different industries were analyzed. The product display and detail screens were screenshot and analyzed by highlighting green for good design practices and red for violating design principles.</p>

            <p>Lululemon, Tim Horton, and Etsy apps are excellent at sectioning complex information and making it more concise and digestible. The use of tabs is very effective in hiding secondary information that may or may not be needed by the users. Sticky call to action button located at the bottom of Tim Hortons app is an excellent example of user control and freedom principle by Nielson. However, bad design practices that violate consistency and standard usability heuristic can be found on Walmart Canada app item display and eBay app item details. There is no standard on clear visual and typographic hierarchy. Also, it violates the common F-reading pattern, which makes it harder to skim.

            <h3>Auditing the Flashfood Grocery App 2.0</h3>
            <p>The Flashfood grocery app version 2.0 user interface was also evaluated using heuristic evaluation. The design principles used are by Donald Norman, 7 principles of good design. Every screen was analyzed, and issues were noted then prioritized based on its impact from high, medium, to low. The list below lists some of the high impact design issues found and the design principles it violates. The auditing effort was meant to highlight bad design practices and note features or parts that need to be fixed in the redesign, specifically on the mocking up and digitizing process. These finds were carried all along the design process so that no same mistakes are repeated. Auditing also helps to make sense of the current experience logic and flow. It helps to understand the system and its limitations better.</p>

            <h3>Shopper journey flow</h3>
            <p>The “traditional” grocery shopping activity was explored through a user journey map method. The goal of using the traditional grocery experience is to understand the common behaviours and shopper patterns in deals and grocery shopping. By learning how the user interacts with the pre-existing system, it provides information for a more seamless Flashfood grocery app integration in the shoppers’ day-to-day grocery shopping activity. Particularly, this user journey map helps to improve the payment process in Flashfood grocery app. For example, the user journey map pointed missing steps like confirmation before hitting the pay button of the version 2.0, which on the map can be seen as “Make sure the number will be paid” step.</p>

          <p>The user journey map for Flashfood grocery app focuses on the primary activity, which is purchasing items. The user journey map was derived from the grocery shopping user journey map. This tool is handy to make sense of logical steps of making a successful purchase. Essentially to answer questions like what is the order of the purchase and what screen comes next. Since each node is colour coded, blue is the shopper and green is Flashfood/the grocery app; the journey map helps to understand the system and how two sides interact through the app. The journey map also highlights when the user needs to make a decision (yellow diamond node) and this helped in designing a more effective user interface that accommodates decision making.</p>

            <h3>Picking critical points and define its features – disassemble</h3>
            <p>The nodes with a red dot on the Flashfood grocery app journey map are the critical points. These are the major activities required to complete a transaction. What it means is these activities are the determinant steps to make a successful transaction. These critical points are the steps need to be focused on as its interactions are more valuable than the other steps. Then each critical point was individually inspected. Features and specification for each critical point were also listed.</p>

            <h3>Paper mock-up – assemble</h3>
            <p>The cheapest and fastest possible way to prototype would probably be a paper mock-up. It only requires papers and a pencil, and low-cost to scrape out the prototype if it does not work out since the designer is not too invested yet. Thus, the paper mock-up method was used before a digital prototype is made to help explorinb the layout and figuring out the navigation of the app. The mock-up contains basic wireframes of all the screens to make a complete purchase. The critical points were brought together with the non-critical points, making the paper mock-up a complete logical purchase flow. Highlighted yellow components are components that are clickable and indicate navigations. The arrows are used to show the flow.</p>

            <h3>Designing for consistency</h3>
            <p>The use of typography in version 2.0 is very inconsistent. There is no clear rule and distinction on how a title, subtitle, or body text should look like. There is no typographic hierarchy and many text variations within the same screen. First, this makes text harder to skim and scan. Second, more variations in the same screen cause more cognitive load for the shoppers. The shoppers need to work harder to process the information. The image below shows that in the version 2.0 item detail screen there are six different typography variations while in the version 2.1, there are only four different typography variations thus information is easier to consume.</p>

            <h3>Designing for modularity</h3>
            <p>Since Flashfood Inc. does not only have one product, it is crucial to create components that are modular so that if a new product needs to be integrated to the Flashfood grocery app, it will feel seamless and will not disrupt the existing shopper's experience with the app. An example to this is the card used in the main view of the app. This card is the module which can be a store card, a message card, or an advertisement card. In the version 2.0 main view, there is no card; stores are just displayed with no clear separation, making it harder to replace it with other things that are not a store. On the other hand, version 2.1 uses a card-based system which allows it to be replaced by various cards making it more modular.</p>

            <h3>Designing for reusability</h3>
            <p>The idea of reusable components is to improve the design and development process by making it faster and more consistent. The reusability can be achieved by having a component that has a specific format and layout but is still modifiable tp be used for other purposes. One example is “short card” component that was used as the base for store info card, payment card, and instruction card. The image below shows the basic layout of the small cards, which is used for all the payment cards (including its different states), instructions card, and store info card. The icon is the visual cue for what the card represents; the primary and secondary texts are the main information, then at the very right is the call to action signifier.</p>

            <h3>Removing View Redundancy</h3>
            <p>In the version 2.0, there are two list views for the stores. Horizontal list, which is the main view and the vertical list. These two list views show the exact same information but the vertical list shows less information due to no map view. This vertical list redundancy is unnecessary because it does not give more information, in fact removing some, thus gives less value to the user. I then decided to replace the vertical list with a store view, showing the items and store information as the users enter the vertical view. The solution will remove the unnecessary redundancy and direct the users right to the view that leads to purchase. However, it comes with motion design challenges. How should the interface and transition be from the horizontal store list to a store view? I brainstormed and came out with a solution that I prototyped using Framer JS. I essentially tried to retain the card view and make it has a seamless transition. As you can see in the video below, the big card transitions to the small card by clipping just the texts and hiding the item images from the big card.</p>

Thus this project meets most of the requirements and goals mentioned, but some requirements still need to be validated in the feature as some features will be released later.

          <h2 class="c1">Learning and Next Step</h2>
          <p>With the redesign successfully done in 2 months, there are some recommendations to improve the design process and the Flashfood grocery app. First, it will be more beneficial to learn directly from the shoppers by incorporating shoppers into the brainstorming process using participatory design. This gives the opportunity for the designers to learn and obtain insights directly from the users of the app in real-time.  Second, a Google Venture design sprints can be added to the process to incorporate the team contributions in the design. This redesign was done mainly by me thus my bias profoundly influences the design. Incorporating more people in the design process will not just adding more ideas and insights, it will also introduce diverse perspectives to the final solutions. This can ultimately reduce a single person bias and yield more thoughtful and neutral solutions.
