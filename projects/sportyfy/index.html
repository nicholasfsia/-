          <h2 class="c4">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>In retail, often, customers are left out by themselves after a transaction happens. The post-purchase experience is rarely touched by retailers though it is equally important as the pre-purchase and purchase experience. Based on our customer interview, we found that customers are sensitive to bad post-purchase experience. With the goal to create an authentic and individualize post-purchase customer experience, we conducted a GV design sprint to solve this problem. The result is a chatbot with three main offerings: SureSave, ExpressReturn, and E-receipt. In addition, I also researched and implemented conversational design to the chatbot I prototyped. Finally, we tested the prototype and  gathered their comments and feedbacks. The participants think the chatbot is very user-friendly and intuitive to use. However, they also think that some of the offerings are too good to be true yet they still really favored the offerings. The skepticism did not hinder them from signing up. The chatbot concept and offerings gained interest from FairVentures retail companies executives. These companies includes SportingLife, GolfTown, Cara Foods, McEwan Food, and Bauer.

          <h2 class="c4">Problems</h2>
          <p>In retail, the volume of innovation in pre-purchase and purchase are really high. On the other hand, customers are left out by themselves after a transaction happens. The post-purchase experience is rarely touched by retailers. Even in studies too, as identified by Kim et al., studies have mainly focused on eliciting more favorable brand attitudes prior to purchase, while largely ignoring the importance of post-purchase brand attitude. One of the reasons retailers choose to focus more on pre-purchase and purchase is because enhancing post-purchase experience does not drive a direct increase in sales. This is an opportunity for FairVentures and MBET students to explore. The core idea is to keep a good relationship with customers even after a purchase happens by building trust and taking care of the customers.</p>
          <br>
          <p>User interview was conducted to validate whether the assumption about the lack of attention to post-purchase experience was true. Seven customers were interviewed about their recent retail experience. We found that people are sensitive to bad post-purchase experience. The power of word of mouth can build or destroy the retailer's reputation. From customer research, it was concluded that post-purchase experience needs more attention and can be an opportunity to leverage retailer-customer relationship.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_block">
          <h2 class="c4">Goals</h2>
          <p>The goal was to create an authentic and individualize post-purchase customer experience. Authentic by focusing on features that achieve customer success and individualized by using a direct conversational interface. Brand attitude change is relatively more positive when consumers’ long-term time orientations are in agreement with affiliative brand singularization (personalize and integrate goods and services into customers’ lives). This was where the chatbot play fits perfectly. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_block above_img">
          <h2 class="c4">Approach</h2>
          <p>In most cases, customers have already used a platform where chatbot can function (e.g. SMS, Facebook Messenger), meaning that they do not need to invest in downloading and keeping a new mobile application on their device. This makes it easier to initiate and keep the retailer-customer relationship in the long-term.</p>

              <h3>GV Design Sprint</h3>
              <p>To generate ideas, the crazy 8 and storyboarding approach from Google Ventures design sprint was used. The list below shows the summary of the crazy 8 ideas clustered based on key post-purchase touchpoints. Under each touchpoint there are ideas generated from crazy 8 and the bolded ones are the chosen ideas to be tested with the customers.</p>

          <h2 class="c4">Conversational Design</h2>
          <p>The prototypes were decided to use two platforms SMS and Facebook Messenger. TextIt was used to create the SMS chatbot and Chatfuel was used to create the Facebook Messenger chatbot. Each platform has its own advantages and disadvantages. The system ended up using SMS as the starter. The system expected to lead the customer to Facebook Messenger through SMS. If the customer still wants to use SMS, the system still provides the exact same features and offerings. It is important to keep it equal whichever platform the customers prefer to reduce technology exclusivity.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Before and while creating the prototype, conversational design principles were explored. The approach to create the prototype was using heuristic analysis. There is no design principle specifically tailored towards chatbot. These conversational design principles are generally obtained from pre-existing design principles, such as Norman’s principle of good design and Nielsen’s Usability heuristics, and also experiments with the users.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Chatbot design constraints are dependent on the platforms, causing some differences in design principles for different platforms. However, there are design principles commonalities for any platform used. Below are the design principles explored and used for the chatbot.</p>

                <p>Designing for emotions requires the system to match the real world (Nielsen), which in chatbot case is being human-like. The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In chatbot, to achieve human-likeness it requires character or persona development. This can be obtained by choosing name, personality, and character. In addition, setting voice and tone helps to carefully construct sentences that emote. In chatbot context, voice means the way words are chosen and phrases are constructed to communicate with the user. Tone, on the other hand, is more situational. It changes on the emotional state of the user. Voice does not change much from day to day, but the tone may vary all the time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sportyfy was chosen as the name of the bot which acts as a sales representative that handles the post-purchase experience. To align with Sportyfy’s “job”, its voice needs to be professional but not administrative, casual but not unreliable, and knowledgeable but not all-knowing.</p>
              <h4>Visibility of system status (Nielsen)</h4>
                <p>In the onboarding, it’s always good to start with a quick introduction of the chatbot and what can the chatbot do. This sets user expectation and creates tolerance towards functionalities that are not supported by the chatbot.</p>

              <h4>Reduce cognitive load – less is more</h4>
                <p>To avoid confusion and cognitive load, rhetorical questions and open-ended questions were avoided whenever possible. Repeating user’s answer whenever necessary is always a good practice. It works not just as a confirmation but also as a feedback (Norman) to the user that the chatbot captures and understands their answer. In addition, simple and concise answers or questions are always more desirable than too long and or too complex answers or questions. However, it is important to not oversimplify or abbreviate language that it may be perceived to be too robotic. People are used to speaking naturall,y that receiving oversimplified answers often results in more cognitive load. Revealing features gradually also helps the customer to digest the information and focus on their main task.</p>

                  <p>While people like having more options, having too many options may hurt them. In addition, based on Hick’s law, the time it takes to decide increases as the number of options increases. For the system to be efficient, unnecessary extra time should be avoided. A good rule to follow is using the magical number seven, plus or minus two. In fact, as the number of options increases past seven, it is difficult for the mind to single out the element that causes inconsistency to scrutinize and correct its relation to the other options, and the result is confusion to the mind from the existing information. This rule was applied to menus, options, and short answers in the chatbot.</p>
                <h4>Conversational whitespace</h4>
                  <p>Delay is a skeuomorphic element in conversational design. What it means is the delay between conversation makes the conversation to be more like a human-human conversation. Like whitespace in interface design, time can be the whitespace in conversational design. In Facebook Messenger, this conversational whitespace is indicated with triple dots.</p>

            <h3>Platform conversational design principle</h3>
              <h4>Facebook Messenger</h4>
                <p>Facebook Messenger has a quite unique set of interface and interactivity that allow the chatbot to constraint the customer flow but still give them the freedom to choose and answer things (Norman). For example, in the Facebook Messenger, short answers , buttons , and share location are very useful for this chatbot. In this case, it is possible to control their answers through buttons and suggest answers to them through short answers.</p>

        <div class="content_block above_img">
          <div class="content_subblock">
              <p>Buttons improve the quality of user inputs but should be used carefully as it may reduce the engagement factor. In terms of conversation, people tend to not use buttons when they are talking or chatting to another people. However, conversation with buttons and visual cues are getting more and more common as the use of emojis, stickers, and thumbs up buttons become popular and are available in most chat platform.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content_block above_img">
          <div class="content_subblock">
              <p>The share location feature from Facebook Messenger reduces steps and effort on entering customers’ address. Customers can share their current location or their desired location to share with the chatbot. This feature is not the natural way to share an address, but sometimes convenience can overcome the unnatural effect of the un-commonality.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Even though Facebook Messenger has these unique functionalities, it is important to remember that not every person has a Facebook Messenger account. If the system relies solely on Facebook Messenger as the only platform for Sportyfy, this can lead to technology exclusivity and low adoption rate.</p>
            <h4>SMS</h4>
              <p>SMS stands for Short Message Service. That means it can only contain short messages, which is in most cases text-based. There are several reasons why this may be a good platform for this chatbot. First, most if not all phones are able to receive and send an SMS, thus can reach more people. Second, it forces any designers to work effectively due to many constraints. However, because there is very little control on customers’ input, it is more difficult to predict customers’ answers. In SMS, there is no luxury of buttons. That means the designer needs to be creative in using numbers as the “buttons” and to carefully not overload the customer with text.</p>

          <div class="content_subblock">
            <h3>SureSave</h3>
            <p>SureSave is a low-price guarantee offered after purchase. The idea of SureSave was derived from sale watch and sale pricing honoring. Customers must make a purchase and are signed up to the Chatbot system. For a certain period, 1 month in this case, if the price of the items they purchase drop, it is guaranteed that the difference will be rewarded to the customer in a form of store credit. In addition, to facilitate the betterment of the customers, customers will be offered an option to donate all or parts of this reward to any organization the retailer partnering with.</p>

          <div class="content_subblock">
            <h3>ExpressReturn</h3>
            <p>ExpressReturn was derived from the idea of easy return. As a customer, returning things can be a lot of work. First, the customer needs to keep the receipt of the transaction. Second, they need to go to a physical store to return it. From the customer perspective, the process of going to a physical store requires a lot of effort. The customer needs to walk or drive or take a public transportation to go to a store. Then they need to find a person in the store that can handle with the return. What if the flow is flipped? Instead of making the customer go back to the store, why do not make the retailers go to the customer? ExpressReturn offers a pickup return service. Meaning that if the customer wants to return something from their purchase, the retailer will send someone to pick it up. This offer will eliminate those two effortful points from the traditional returning process.</p>

            <h3>E-receipt</h3>
            <p>Customers often keep their receipts to keep track on their spending. However, a paper receipt can sometimes be a problem because it is easily get lost. E-receipt offers a digital copy of the receipt that can be accessed by a digital device through chatbot and cannot be lost easily.</p>

          <h2 class="c4">User Testing and Validation</h2>
          <p>The user testing techniques used were design walkthrough and user interview. The participants were chosen to match the chosen persona. Ten participants were chosen for the user testing. The goal of the user testing was:</p>
          <ul class="ul4 ul_content">
            <li>to understand what kind of value proposition is needed for someone to provide their phone number or messenger account,</li>
            <li>to understand how people respond to ExpressReturn and SureSale conversation flows,</li>
            <li>to find out how this bot concept might have fit into the participant’s recent retail purchases, and</li>
            <li>o find out what a customer might also want this contact point for.</li>
            <p>The prototype that was used for the interview purposes was the Facebook Messenger chatbot.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They found that the chatbot is very user-friendly and intuitive to use. The conversational design principles that were applied in the prototypes seemed to work well. There were a lot of comments saying that the features are too good to be true yet they still really favored the features offered by Sportyfy. This skepticism did not hinder them from signing up.</p>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="content_block">
          <h2 class="c4">Learning and Next Step</h2>
          <p>The use of chatbot for post-purchase engagement worked well as more than half of the participants will recommend the chatbot to their social circle. Even though there were no pre-existing design principles specifically tailored toward conversational design, conversational design principles can be derived from the existing general design principles and experiments. For adoption, the majority of millennials interviewed were willing to provide their phone number at the point of purchase to sign-up for post-sale retail services. Participants loved the features and offers, especially the easy return (ExpressReturn) and the low-price guarantee after purchase (SureSave), but still, they were skeptical that these features and offers were possible and realistic. However, this skepticism did not hinder the participants from signing up.</p>
          <br>
          <p>For the future of the project, there are several recommendations that can be done for the project to be successful and applicable. One of the goals of the project was to leverage income. However, up to this point, the focus of the project was to create a good relationship with the customer and offer post-purchase features to improve customer satisfaction. It is reasonable for the next step to explore the desired solutions’ viability and feasibility because if the system is not viable, the system may not gain any interest from the retailer, and if technology wise is impossible, the system cannot exist in the real world.</p>
